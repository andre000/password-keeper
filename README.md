# Password Keeper

Password manager web application. It uses the [Password Keeper API](https://github.com/andre000/password-keeper-api).
Project made as POC. I don't know how secure actually is.

It uses: 
- Vue.js
- Nuxt
- Ant Design Vue
- Vue Apollo
- [Tiptap](https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
